# own implementation of the standard string library with additional features from C#

s21_memchr - Searches for the first occurrence of the character c in the first n bytes of the string pointed to by str.  

s21_memcmp - Compares the first n bytes of str1 and str2.  

s21_memcpy - Copies n characters from src to dest.  

s21_memset - Copies the character c to the first n characters of the string.  

s21_strncat - Adds the string src to the end of the string dest, up to n characters long.  

s21_strchr - Searches for the first occurrence of the character c in the string pointed to by str.  

s21_strncmp - Compares at most the first n bytes of str1 and str2.  

s21_strncpy - Copies up to n characters from src to dest.  

s21_strcspn - Calculates the length of the initial segment of str1, which consists entirely of characters not included in str2.  

s21_strerror - Returns a pointer to the error message string number errnum.  

s21_strlen - Returns the length of string.  

s21_strpbrk - Returns zero or the portion of the string trimmed by the closest match of any element of the second string.  

s21_strrchr - Returns null or part of the string trimmed by matching a character from the end of the string.  

s21_strstr - Returns zero or the portion of the string trimmed by matching the string needle.  

s21_strtok - Returns null or the portion of the string truncated by a match of the character (delimiter) of the second string, changing that character in the original string to a null terminator.  

s21_to_upper - Returns a copy of the string str converted to uppercase 

s21_to_lower - Returns a copy of the string str converted to lowercase

s21_insert - Returns a new row where the specified string (src) is inserted at the specified position (start_index) in the given string (dst).  

s21_trim - Returns s21_NULL or a pointer to a new string with the first and last characters in the string trim_chars removed.  

s21_sprintf - output to the dst strig based on the supplied format string, objects corresponding to the given format string.  

s21_sscanf - reading from the src string using the supplied format string, values for objects corresponding to this format string.  

s21_itoa - converting an integer to a string.  

s21_ftoa -converting a floating point number to a string.  

s21_atoiPlus - converting a string to a integer depending on the specifier.  

s21_atofPlus - converting a string to a floating point number depending on the specifier.
